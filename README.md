# Clicky Game
This application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
